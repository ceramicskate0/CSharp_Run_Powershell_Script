# CSharp_Run_Powershell_Script

C# class to run powershell from c# binary/dll without powershell.exe. 

Also for some reason...i couldnt find powershell logs for what is run via this code.

Script must be on disk with the current way its coded.

BUT its not to much work to change that, but thats up to you. 

Sorry red team. But idea for you.

Phish/dropper (get caught YEY Blue). Now what it could do...

VNC Apps (Can use 443)

Tor/Tunnel (Sneaky 443)

Client Side Complies: cd \Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v{Version Number} csc.exe /unsafe /reference:{Call all in .cs File 1 ref arg per ref} /win32icon:C:\p0wnedShell{ProjName}.ico /out:C:{ProjName\Path}.{Extension}(ie exe or DLL) /platform:x86 "C:{Proj location}*.cs"

Dont use for evil.
