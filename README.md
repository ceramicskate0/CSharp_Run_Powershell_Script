# CSharp_Run_Powershell_Script
C# class to run powershell from c# binary/dll without powershell.exe. 

Also for some reason...i couldnt find powershell logs for what is run via this code.

Script must be on disk with the current way its coded.

Sorry red team. 

BUT its not to much work to change that, but thats up to you. Dont use for evil.
